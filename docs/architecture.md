# System Architecture

## Overview

The system is designed as a distributed search engine with multiple components working together to provide efficient web crawling, indexing, and query processing. The architecture is modular, with each module handling a specific part of the search engine's functionality.

## Core Components

1. **Web Crawler**
   - Responsible for crawling web pages and collecting data.
   - Manages URL queues, fetches pages, and extracts relevant content.
   - Built using Python and Go for handling concurrency and efficiency in crawling.

2. **Indexing**
   - Organizes crawled data into an inverted index for fast retrieval.
   - Implements compression techniques for optimized storage.
   - Written in Java, focusing on efficient large-scale data handling.

3. **Query Processing**
   - Parses and processes user queries, providing relevant search results.
   - Supports Boolean, phrase, and fuzzy queries.
   - Mix of Java and Python to handle both real-time and pre-processed query optimizations.

4. **Ranking and Relevance**
   - Implements ranking algorithms (e.g., BM25, PageRank) to provide relevant search results.
   - Includes personalization and relevance feedback mechanisms.
   - Entirely implemented in Java to leverage strong computational performance.

5. **Search Interface**
   - Provides the front-end for users to interact with the search engine.
   - Contains both web UI and API for programmatic access.
   - Developed in Python, using frameworks such as Flask or FastAPI for the web interface.

6. **Storage and Management**
   - Manages the storage of crawled content and metadata.
   - Uses a combination of Go and Java to optimize concurrency and data handling.

7. **Scalability and Distributed Systems**
   - Distributes tasks such as crawling, indexing, and querying across multiple nodes.
   - Provides fault tolerance and load balancing mechanisms.
   - Implemented in Go and Java for optimal performance in distributed environments.

8. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Tracks system performance, crawls, and user queries.
   - Uses Go for metric collection and Prometheus for monitoring.

## Data Flow

1. Crawling begins with a set of seed URLs.
2. Crawled pages are processed, and content is extracted.
3. The extracted content is indexed and stored in the inverted index.
4. Users submit queries, which are parsed and processed.
5. Results are ranked and returned to the user through the search interface.
