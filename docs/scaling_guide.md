# Scaling Guide

This document provides guidelines for scaling the search engine to handle increased data and query load.

## 1. Horizontal Scaling

### Crawling

Distribute crawling tasks across multiple nodes using the `distributed_crawling` module. The `crawler_coordinator.go` manages this distribution by splitting tasks between nodes.

### Indexing

The `distributed_indexing` package allows for index sharding. Use `index_partitioning.java` to partition the index across nodes, and `index_merger.java` to combine results from different nodes when necessary.

### Query Processing

Implement load balancing for query processing using `query_load_balancer.go`, which distributes query requests across multiple nodes to reduce response time.

## 2. Vertical Scaling

### Increase Resources

For resource-intensive components (e.g., indexing), increase the CPU and memory allocation in the container or cloud setup.

### Database Scaling

Ensure that the underlying database (used by the document store) supports sharding and replication. Use `document_db.go` for distributed document storage and `replication.go` for redundancy.

## 3. Monitoring

Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system performance. Pre-configured dashboards are located in `monitoring/grafana_dashboards/`.

## 4. Load Balancing

For high query traffic, distribute load using `query_load_balancer.go`. You can configure rules to route requests to the least busy node or use a round-robin strategy.

## 5. Fault Tolerance

Ensure fault tolerance by enabling replication for critical services, managed by `replication.go` and `failover_manager.java`. This ensures continued operation even if individual nodes fail.

## 6. Autoscaling

Set up Kubernetes autoscaling by configuring `kubernetes/manifests/deployment.yaml` to scale pods based on CPU or memory usage.
