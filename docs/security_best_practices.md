# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for ensuring data privacy and system integrity.

## 1. Authentication

- Use API key-based authentication for API access. See `api_key_auth.py`.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication using `oauth2_auth.java`.

## 2. Access Control

Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized users can access certain features. Configure RBAC using `rbac.py`.

## 3. Data Encryption

All data at rest and in transit must be encrypted:

- Use `data_encryption.py` for encrypting documents and queries.
- Ensure TLS is enabled for all API endpoints.

## 4. Privacy Compliance

Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA):

- Use `data_anonymization.java` to anonymize user data.
- Implement consent management with `consent_management.py`.

## 5. Logging and Monitoring

Set up centralized logging using `log_config.py` and monitor for suspicious activity.
Define alert rules in `alert_rules.yaml` to notify of security anomalies.

## 6. Penetration Testing

Perform regular penetration testing using `security_tests/penetration_test.py` to identify vulnerabilities.

## 7. Patch Management

Ensure that all components are regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
